# Portfolio
Using HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, I designed a responsive portfolio


My solution is to build a elegant website which showcases my skills and projects. I have categorized my portfolio website into five sections namely,
Homepage
Skills
Projects
About
Contact


Apart from HTML 5, CSS , JS and Bootstrap, I have implemented transitions, animations and linked the contact page to the csv file.


For implementing animations, I have used AOS ( Animate On Scroll ) and I also added hover attributes to the portfolio
